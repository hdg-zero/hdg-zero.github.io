This is my first article. I'll be talking about tech, discoveries, and occasional rants.

## Why Astro?

After testing Next.js, Nuxt, and other frameworks, I finally chose **Astro** for my portfolio. Here's why:

- **Performance**: Static HTML by default means it's fast
- **Flexibility**: I can use React, Vue, or nothing at all
- **DX**: The developer experience is excellent

## What I learned

Building this site helped me consolidate my knowledge in:

1. Tailwind CSS v4 and its new features
2. Astro's Content Collections
3. View Transitions for smooth animations

> "The best framework is the one that lets you ship quickly."

See you soon for more!
